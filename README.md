This repository contains the merged data from [Varikin](https://github.com/SamPassmore/kinbank), [Parabank](https://github.com/parabank/parabank-kinship-data), [Kinura](https://github.com/kinbank/kinura), and [MPEGKin](https://github.com/kinbank/goeldi)

Since this dataset is an amalgamation of four different datasets, it is not appropriate to add new data to this repository. It will be overwritten when the dataset is regenerated. 

New data should be added to one of the four sub-datasets:
* [Varikin](https://github.com/kinbank/varikin)
* [Parabank](https://github.com/kinbank/parabank)
* [Kinura](https://github.com/kinbank/kinura)
* [MPEGKin](https://github.com/kinbank/goeldi)

If you are already affiliated with one of these datasets, contact the group leader to ask about how to add new data. 
If you are not affiliated with any of the existing projects, create an [issue](https://github.com/kinbank/kinbank/issues) in this repository and the Kinbank team will contact you as soon as possible.
